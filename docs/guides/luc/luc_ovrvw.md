# Lenovo Updates Catalog

## **Overview**
The Lenovo Updates Catalog is a Lenovo curated catalog of update information available for subscription and synchronization found in the Software Library > Overview > Software Updates > Third-Party Software Update Catalogs node in Configuration Manager.  The catalog contains update information categorized by model in the V3 format.  The V3 catalog format provides granular control of the update metadata and content made available to endpoints in an environment.
## **Lenovo Brands Included in the Catalog**
The Lenovo Updates catalog provides update metadata and content for ThinkPad, ThinkStation, and ThinkCentre devices.  The Lenovo Updates catalog does not provide update metadata and content for IdeaPad, IdeaCentre, Legion, Lenovo, ThinkBook, ThinkCentre Neo, ThinkEdge, ThinkServer, or ThinkSmart devices.
## **Lenovo Updates Catalog Agent**
To ensure Lenovo Updates are correctly detected as either applicable, installed, or not needed, the Lenovo Updates Catalog Agent is a required software update.   To ensure success in an environment, deploy this update to all Lenovo ThinkPad, ThinkStation, or ThinkCentre devices under management by Configuration Manager.  For more information, please refer to the [Lenovo Update Catalog Agent](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/docs/guides/luc/luc_agnt) informational guide.
## **Lenovo Content Provided in the Catalog**
In the Lenovo Updates Catalog, we attempt to provide as many drivers, BIOS, and applications as possible.  Due to certain content restrictions and limitations from WSUS, we cannot provide firmware (including Docking Stations) and some drivers due to vendor limitations.

## Dock Manager FAQ <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<details>
<summary>Why is Dock Manager not showing the firmware version of the connected dock?</summary>
This can occur right after Dock Manager is installed.  For older docks, Dock Manager must first download the firmware update package for that dock so it can use the firmware update tool in the package to get the current firmware version on the attached dock. If Dock Manager is configured to pull from a local repository, make sure the appropriate packages are in the repository for your targeted docks.

For new docks released in 2021, Dock Manager can read the firmware version directly and does not have this limitation.

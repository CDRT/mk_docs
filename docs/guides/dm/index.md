# Dock Manager Overview

## Preface

Lenovo Dock Manager is a new solution that reduces the effort that IT administrators spend on the large scale deployment of Lenovo dock firmware updates.  This solution runs on your PC and maintains a cache of the current firmware versions for supported Lenovo docks.  When a dock is attached that has down-level firmware, it is automatically updated by Dock Manager.  Video resources and links that may be helpful can be found below:

Dock Manager can automatically download firmware updates from Lenovo Support directly over the Internet or from a local repository on your network that is created and maintained using Update Retriever. The four-character "machine type" for the supported docks listed below can be used in Update Retriever when searching for the latest firmware packages.

The application can also record data from docks into WMI (root\Lenovo\Dock_Manager) for administrators to query remotely for management purposes.  Such details can include:

* Dock Machine Type
* Firmware Version
* MAC Address
* Connected Devices - Monitors, USB Devices

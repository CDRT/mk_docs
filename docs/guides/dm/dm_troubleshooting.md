## Dock Manager Troubleshooting Tips

### Scheduled Task Does Not Launch

#### Background & Problem

Dock Manager checks the new firmware in the repository at a scheduled time. IT admins can use Windows Group Policy to push scheduling settings to client's PCs.​

- Refer to [User Manual](https://download.lenovo.com/consumer/options/dockmanager_user_manual.pdf) , section 5.5.​

Sometimes customer's may encounter an issue that the scheduled firmware checking task does not launch at an expected time.​ This document will explain how to troubleshoot the issue.

#### Critical Steps for Troubleshooting

There are 3 critical steps for troubleshooting​:

   1. On a domain controller, check Group Policy Management Editor to make sure group policy settings are properly configured.​
   2. On a client PC, check registry to make sure group policy settings are properly deployed.​
   3. On a client PC, check Task Scheduler to make sure scheduled task exists.   

#### Troubleshooting

The following example is based on a weekly firmware checking task is set to run at **6:05 am** on **every Monday and Tuesday**.

##### Check Group Policy

1. IT admins should first check Group Policy settings on domain controller.

##### Check the Registry

IT admins should then check the registry on a client PC where the issue can be replicated. In the illustrated path, make sure **Frequency**, **RunAt** and **RunOn** exists with correct values. Refer to the screenshot below:

##### Check Task Scheduler

As the last steps, IT admins should check Task Scheduler on the same client PC. 

1. Right click **Run as administrator** to launch Task Scheduler.​

- Task Scheduler should be launched with elevated privileges otherwise some tasks may not be shown.

2. Make sure a task named **DockManager – Task Scheduler** is under the illustrated folder.​

3. Make sure **Triggers** is configured correctly. Refer to the screenshot:

4. Check **Last Run Time** and **Last Run Result** to find more details and possible cause.

#### Conclusion

In Dock Manager, scheduled firmware checking task failing to run is normally caused by improperly deployed group policy settings.​

When the issue happens, IT admin should check both domain controller and client PC to determine whether group policy settings are properly deployed.​

- Group Policy Management Editor on domain controller​
- Registry on client PC​
- Task Scheduler on client PC​

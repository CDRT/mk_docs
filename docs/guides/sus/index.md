- :material-cloud-download: __System Update__ <br>
    Automates patch and update management with a light local client that      intelligently identifies and locates necessary updates; either from Lenovo over the Internet or from a local repository created and maintained with Update Retriever.

- :material-database: __Update Retriever__ <br>
    Helps IT streamline the process of finding and downloading specific device updates and building targeted repositories on local networks or in the cloud. Constructing secure update repositories is a critical step in maintaining endpoint security and readiness. Lenovo Update Retriever brings automation and intelligence to this important task.

- :material-tools: __Thin Installer__ <br>
    Works with Update Retriever to pull drivers, software, and system updates from the cloud or a customized update repository on your network.  It is ideal for use in scripted environments. With a minimalist user interface, Thin Installer can simply be copied to the target device; no installation required.

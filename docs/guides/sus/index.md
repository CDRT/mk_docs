# System Update Suite

System Update Suite consists of Lenovo System Update, Update Retriever and Thin Installer.

***System Update*** automates patch and update management with a light local client that intelligently identifies and locates necessary updates; either from Lenovo over the Internet or from a local repository created and maintained with Update Retriever.

***Update Retriever*** helps IT streamline the process of finding and downloading specific device updates and building targeted repositories on local networks or in the cloud. Constructing secure update repositories is a critical step in maintaining endpoint security and readiness. Lenovo Update Retriever brings automation and intelligence to this important task.

***Thin Installer*** works with Update Retriever to pull drivers, software, and system updates from the cloud or a customized update repository on your network.  It is ideal for use in scripted environments. With a minimalist user interface, Thin Installer can simply be copied to the target device; no installation required.

# BIOS Reference

This section will provide information on deploying updates for BIOS (aka UEFI) on ThinkPad, ThinkCentre and ThinkStation products.  

It will also offer a Settings Dictionary where details on individual BIOS settings can be explained.  Not all models will support all settings.  It is recommended to use a sample system to review the available settings and refer to these pages if there are any questions on the individual settings.

Another useful resource is the [Lenovo BIOS Simulator page](https://download.lenovo.com/bsco/index.html#/){:target=”_blank”} which provides a visual simulation of what the actual BIOS Setup interface looks like on a specified system.

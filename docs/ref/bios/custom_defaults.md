# Custom BIOS Defaults

This function was introduced in 2023 products and allows you to:

- save the current BIOS Setup settings as custom BIOS default settings
- load a custom BIOS default to replace the current BIOS settings

It is important to note that Security, Date & Time, and Boot Order settings are excluded from the custom defaults.

!!! note ""
    If a user performs the Reset System to Factory Defaults function under the Security menu, the custom defaults will be cleared and the system will revert back to the factory default settings.

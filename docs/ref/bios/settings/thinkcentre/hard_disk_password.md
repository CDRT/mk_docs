# Hard Disk Password

![Hard Disk Password](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/ref/bios/settings/thinkcentre/img/tc_hard_disk_password.PNG)

One setting per drive. Total number of drives depends on model.

All of the following passwords default to `Disabled`.

A Hard Disk Password prevents unauthorized users from accessing the data from the hard disk.

In addition to the User Password, a optional Master Password can be used to recover the disk if the user password is lost.

    If several disks are present, we recommend setting all Hard Disk Passwords to the same.

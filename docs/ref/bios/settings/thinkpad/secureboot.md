## Key Management

![Key Management](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/ref/bios/settings/thinkpad/img/securebootkeysmanagement.png)

Platform Key (PK)
:  The platform key establishes a trust relationship between the platform owner and the platform firmware.

    The platform owner enrolls the public half of the key into the platform firmware.

    The platform owner can later use the private half of the key to change platform ownership or to enroll a Key Exchange Key.

    Standard Windows commands are supported:

    - [Windows Secure Boot Key Creation and Management Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-key-creation-and-management-guidance)

Key Exchange Key (KEK)
:  Key exchange keys establish a trust relationship between the operating system and the platform firmware.

    Each operating system (and potentially, each 3rd party application that needs to communicate with platform firmware) enrolls a public key into the platform firmware.

    Standard Windows commands are supported:

    - [Windows Secure Boot Key Creation and Management Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-key-creation-and-management-guidance)

Authorized Signature Database (DB)
:  Database keys shows the list of allowed certificates.

    System will check digital signatures of bootloaders using public keys in the DB.

    Only software or firmware which has a bootloader signed with a corresponding private key will be allowed to run.

    Standard Windows commands are supported:

    - [Windows Secure Boot Key Creation and Management Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-key-creation-and-management-guidance)

Forbidden Signature Database (DBX)
:  Forbidden Signature Database shows not allowed certificates.

    System will block any software or firmware signed with a corresponding private key.

    Standard Windows commands are supported:

    - [Windows Secure Boot Key Creation and Management Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-key-creation-and-management-guidance)

# Reset System to Factory Defaults

![](./img/tp_resetsystemtofactorydefaults.png)

This option was introduced in 2023 products and is different than the Load Setup Defaults or Load Factory Defaults option found under Restart.

This option will clear all data stored in the UEFI system.  It does not affect the SSD storage data. After selecting this item the system will automatically reboot and reset to factory default settings.

# Lenovo BIOS Settings Dictionary  <!-- {docsify-ignore-all} -->

This section will be divided between ThinkPad, ThinkCentre and ThinkStation to describe the various BIOS settings available on these platforms.

Not all models implement all settings so it is recommended to review a sample system to identify which settings are implemented and then refer to these pages if there are any questions regarding a particular setting.

Sample images are shown for example purposes only. Not all settings shown are applicable to each machine.

<details><summary> {DriveType} {X} Password</summary>

Set a Hard Disk Password (HDP) to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the data on the Hard Disk.

?> In addition to the User password and optional Master Password, the HDP can be used to recover the disk if the User Password is lost.

One setting for each drive's password:

 - {DriveType} - M.2, PCIe, or SATA
 - {X} - one of a number of the same type of drive.

For each drive it is possible to define a separate password, or leave a drive without a password.

Options:

1. Enabled – HDP (single or dual) is installed.
2. **Disabled** – HDP is not installed. Default.

Additional choice of the password type:
1. **Single Password** - Default.
2. Dual Password (User+Admin).

?> When a single HDP is set, the user must enter the user password to access files and applications on the storage drive.

?> The admin HDP is set and used by a system administrator. It enables the administrator to access any storage drive in a system or any computer connected in the same network.

?> The administrator can also assign a user HDP for each computer in the network. The user of the computer can change the user HDP as desired, but only the administrator can remove the user HDP. 

<!-- TODO: confirm parameters -->

While enabling the following parameters are available:
1. `Enter New Password`
2. `Confirm New Password`
3. Show Password – `On` \ `Off` statuses
4. < Actions >: <br>
    a. **Save** – default<br>
    b. Cancel

?> If several disks are present, it’s suggested to set all Hard Disk Passwords to the same. 

</details>

<details><summary>Require HDP on System Boot</summary>

Whether HDP is required when the Hard Disk is in lock status, and system starts from one of the states:
- full off
- hibernate
- restart

?> When `no` is selected, HDP is still required when the hard disk is attached to a different system.

Options:

1. **Auto** – HDP required. Default.
2. No – HDP will not be required.

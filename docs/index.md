## Who We Are

The Commercial Deployment Readiness Team is a small group of dedicated professionals inside Lenovo that focus our attention on all things related to deploying and managing our portfolio of commercial PC products.  We do not focus on our consumer or SMB portfolio because we simply don't have the time or resources.  You may have encountered some of our other work:

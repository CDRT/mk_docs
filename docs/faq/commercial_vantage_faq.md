!!! note "Can I control the System Update process by command line?"
    No.  Because Commercial Vantage is a UWP app, the process to get driver and firmware updates cannot be initiated by command line.

    To control the update process, use the Commercial Vantage policies that define the timing and filtering as needed.  

    See [Commercial Vantage Policies](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/guides/cv/commercial-vantage-policies/) under the System Update category for more details.

Refer to this introduction article with links to the SU Helper reference guide:  https://blog.lenovocdrt.com/introducing-su-helper-utility/</p> <p>You may also continue to use the group policy controls to control the update process by defining the timing and filtering as needed.</p> <p>Refer to the CommercialVantage.admx under the System Update category for more details.</p> <p>When Commercial Vantage is installed, will it automatically create a scheduled task to install System Updates?</p> <p>A scheduled task is created by a background process a few minutes after installation.  The scheduled task is configured to run weekly, at a random day/time.  The randomness helps manage the load on Lenovo's server (e.g. so that not every Lenovo PC in the world is checking for updates at the same time).  If the PC happens to be turned off (or sleeping) at the time the scheduled task is triggered, then Windows itself should try to execute the scheduled task as soon as possible after it is missed.  The scheduled task can be found in Task Scheduler -&gt; Task Scheduler Library -&gt; Lenovo -&gt; ImController -&gt; Plugins -&gt; LenovoSystemUpdatePlugin_WeeklyTask.  There is an additional task (LenovoSystemUpdatePlugin_TVSUUpdateTask_Once) which is designed to run 1 time shortly after installation to install any pending critical updates.</p> <p>Can the administrator use a Group Policy to configure a schedule?</p> <p>Yes, there are policies for this in Group Policy Editor -&gt; Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Commercial Vantage -&gt; Device -&gt; System Update.

It is not installed by default, so if you choose to install it, please uncomment the installation line near the end of the setup-commercial-vantage.bat file by removing <code>@REM</code> from the beginning of the line.</p> <p>The utility can also be installed separately on devices silently using the following command:</p> <p><code>[installer filename] /VERYSILENT</code></p> <p>The utility is designed to be installed in a fixed, secure location under Program Files so that it cannot be altered without Administrator privileges.</p> <p>The utility can be uninstalled with the following command:</p> <p><code>C:\\Program Files\\Lenovo\\SUHelper\\unins000.exe /VERYSILENT</code></p> <p>Note</p> <p>In the Enterprise package released in July 2025, there is a new option for installing SU Helper. The package includes VantageInstaller.exe which can also be used to install SU Helper. With VantageInstaller.exe it is possible to install Commercial Vantage and SU Helper at the same time.</p>"},{"location":"guides/cv/suhelper/#intended-usage-scenarios","title":"Intended Usage Scenarios","text":"<p>SUHelper is designed to support a few scenarios to provide IT administrators more control over the updating of their devices.</p> Trigger Auto Update In this scenario, there may be cases where an admin wants to trigger an Auto Update session without waiting for the normal schedule to be triggered. Trigger Auto Update for filtered updates In this scenario, the admin may want to trigger an update session that only installs certain package types, reboot types or even specific updates specified by their package IDs. An example where this would be useful is if you leverage Windows Update for Business for driver and firmware updates; however, there is a particular update that is not offered through Windows Update which you need to have deployed immediately. Commercial Vantage can be deployed on devices with Auto Update disabled and SUHelper can be used on-demand to install specific updates just be sending the command to the clients. Exclude an update from being installed In some cases, a customer may find that a particular update has a compatibility issue with their environment when they apply the update to a set of test devices. To prevent that update from being applied to all production devices, SUHelper can be used to add the specific package ID(s) to an \"exclude\" list on the production devices. This will cause the specified update to be ignored when an Auto Update or a Manual Update is executed."},{"location":"guides/cv/suhelper/#command-line-reference","title":"Command-line Reference","text":"<p>SUHELPER [-autoupdate] [-include [string]] [-exclude [string]] [-packagetype [string]] [-reboottype [string]] [-allowdefer] [-help]</p>"},{"location":"guides/cv/suhelper/#-autoupdate","title":"-autoupdate","text":"<p>Required parameter.

The data in the WMI class is used during the scanning and evaluation of Lenovo updates from the WSUS server.</p> <p>How Do the Updates Use the WMI Information?</p> <p>All updates contain IsInstalled and IsInstallable rules to evaluate applicability.\u00a0 The Lenovo Updates Catalog contains all the metadata in the form of queries to determine the applicability of the Driver and Software Utility updates.\u00a0 The data aggregated by the Lenovo Updates Catalog Agent and placed into the WMI class is leveraged by the IsInstalled and IsInstallable applicability rules from the catalog.\u00a0 All Lenovo Updates perform a check against the Manufacturer and BIOS versions to target the correct model.\u00a0 For more specific targeting, Lenovo Updates can also leverage checks against PNPID/HardwareID information, driver versions, or driver dates, specific BIOS Versions, OS Versions, OS Build, and OS Architecture.\u00a0 The checks against the PNPID/HardwareID information, driver versions, or driver dates use the data from the Win32_PNPSignedDriverEx class during evaluation.</p> <p>What Initiates the Lenovo Updates Catalog Agent to Run?</p> <p>The 2 triggers that cause the Lenovo Updates Catalog Agent to run are the Software Updates Scan Cycle or Software Updates Deployment Evaluation Cycle.\u00a0 These cycles can be initiated in multiple ways: by the Configuration Manager Client Settings schedule, manually starting from a device or collection from\u00a0 within the Configuration Manager console, or manually running them from the Configuration Manager Client Actions on the local device.\u00a0 These cycles ultimately cause the Windows Update Agent to start, which then causes the Lenovo Updates Catalog Agent to populate the WMI Class.</p> <p>Where to Find the Lenovo Updates Catalog Agent?</p> <p>After subscribing and synchronizing the Lenovo Updates Catalog in Configuration Manager, in the console, navigate to Administration &gt; Overview &gt; Site Configuration &gt; Sites.

This severity level should be the default for most drivers. A recommended package can be, for example:</p> <ul> <li>A video driver that corrects an issue that may cause blue screen issues.</li> <li>A BIOS update that contains minor fixes that may impact a small group of customers.</li> <li>A power management driver that will allow a mobile system to get the most out of its battery life.</li> </ul> <p>Optional update packages  will improve the computing experience but are not necessary. An optional package can be, for example:</p> <ul> <li>An application or utility that is not needed for the system to operate but provides benefit if it is installed.</li> <li>Any BIOS or driver upgrade that has been updated only to support newer systems and contains no fixes.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Some of updates may depend on certain Window components.

Use standard network troubleshooting steps to verify the logged-on user account has access as required.</p> <p>When pulling content from Lenovo, System Update uses HTTPS to access content at https://download.lenovo.com/catalog  and https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs .

Although Thin Installer does not pull content directly from Lenovo it may still require troubleshooting access to the local repository on the intranet network.

For instance, if Thin Installer is launched using a process under the Local System context, it may not have access to a network share that has been granted read/write access to Everyone.

Within the process used by Update Retriever to process catalogs for specified models, there are several CRC checks performed on the files that are downloaded. There may be times when the catalogs and the content are out of synch as the catalogs are being refreshed. In this case Update Retriever may report that it failed to download an update or may not offer any update that should be available. These types of issues are typically addressed automatically due to the continuous nature of the catalog maintenance processes but may take a day or two to be resolved. In other cases there may be an incorrect CRC value specified for a file causing it to continuously fail to download. These issues will be identified in the error messages presented by Update Retriever and can be reported in the Enterprise Client Management forum which can be linked to from the Enterprise Deployment Solutions page (https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht104232) .

Update Retriever cannot change how an update was designed to run. Therefore, it is typically recommended to not change this value for any updates using Update Retriever.</li> <li>Update Retriever has been installed on a new system; however, the System List is empty: The System List is recorded in the registry and can be copied from the old system to the new system.

When launched by a user in Windows, the application will attempt to relaunch itself with administrative privileges which causes a User Account Control dialog to be displayed with the Program Name of \"Microsoft (R) HTML application host\" and the Verified Publisher as \"Microsoft Windows\".  This occurs because access to the WMI BIOS Settings interface requires administrative privileges on the system and there is no \"Run as Administrator\" option for .HTA files.

This feature is also available via command line which is discussed in the Execution via Command Line section.</p> <p>On the right, an .INI file of the current settings can be generated simply by clicking Export Settings.  The file will be generated in the working directory the application is launched from.  The file will be named \\&lt;model&gt;Config.ini where \\&lt;model&gt; is the text inside the parenthesis above the Settings Table.  The settings that are exported are the current settings of the machine AND the pending changes to the machine.  This is done to allow the user to create these files without  having to commit changes to the machine.  The created file has an optional first line if there is a supervisor password and the remaining lines are of the form key,value.

In most cases, the user should only have to supply the password and leave the other fields as they are. The password box is for the Supervisor password on the targeted machine. The encrypting key box is only used if the Export Settings function will be used to capture the settings of this targeted machine into an .INI file.  A random 16 character string can be generated or the user can create their own personal encryption key using characters from this set: a-z, A-Z, 0-9.  Do not use any punctuation or special characters.  This will allow the Supervisor password to be encrypted using xxTEA in the .INI file, which is simply plain text. The encrypting key would be used later when the tool is used to apply the settings in the .INI file.</p> <p>Under the first security action section is the area to change the current supervisor password. By providing the new password, the user can click the Change password button to change the current machine\u2019s password or click the Create password change file button to generate a file to change the password on multiple machines.

In some organizations other aspects are to be considered when updating the BIOS, such as performing an update when a Supervisor Password is present or even a fully automated PXE deployment that can, with some management, update the BIOS in your organization in a tightly controlled environment.</p> <p>Updating the BIOS has to be done carefully to ensure that it is applied to the system without issue. BIOS updates for Lenovo Think brand devices are best applied from a local resource, such as the C:\\ drive or the system drive in the full running Operating System, or from the X:\\ drive in WinPE.

WINUPTP also supports a \u2013r command line parameter to force a reboot after prestaging the new BIOS image file.

First, installing the BIOS update from a local hard drive is the safest choice. Since that is a requirement, use a copy command to copy the BIOS installer from the network to the local hard drive. Second, in a step to run an executable, call the WINUPTP tool with the \u2013s command line parameter. The final step is to initiate a system reboot through the task sequence.</p> <p>It is best practice to not use the \u2013r command line parameter in a task sequence. When running task sequences, it is best practice to allow the task sequence to control the reboot and not allow the installing executable to do so.

One of the first layers of security we provide is within our hardware, specifically the BIOS. BIOS Security governs how accessible the operating system can be to users, administrators, and hackers. Lenovo currently stands on the premise that our BIOS should be highly secure, therefore we will err on the side of security over manageability. We strive to be more secure than other manufacturers while retaining a reasonable level of manageability.</p> <p>Lenovo utilizes passwords to control access to different aspects of the computer. Passwords are not set from the factory unless requested by a customer and implemented for a specific custom model being ordered. Passwords can be utilized to protect the BIOS interface, power on of the computer, and hard disk.</p> <p>The BIOS interface is protected by the Supervisor Password (SVP). The Supervisor password must be provided when any settings are changed via scripting. The Supervisor password must be entered when accessing the BIOS by physical means in order to provide access to various security settings.</p> <p>The powering on of the device is protected by the Power-On Password (POP). This will allow the computer to power on directly to a password prompt but go no further until the correct password is entered. The computer will not prompt for any other type of boot via the F12 boot menu. This will limit the access to the OS and BIOS.</p> <p>These passwords can be set manually through the BIOS interface itself or can be set/changed by script with the limitation of the Supervisor Password. Lenovo does not support the ability to set the initial password by script to limit the security exposure of locking both administrators and users out of a computer. Once the Supervisor password is set, it can be changed by script. Many customers opt to have Lenovo set the Supervisor password at the factory. Once the customer knows the preset password, they can change it during initial deployment of the computer in their environment.</p> <p>For more information about BIOS Security around passwords, check https:\\pcsupport.lenovo.com and search for the specific model. The User Guide in the documentation area will contain specifics on these passwords.</p> <p>Lenovo leverages WMI through scripting API\u2019s to detect if any of the BIOS passwords are set. The script returns the state of the following passwords: Supervisor (SVP), Power on (POP), User HDD, and User HDD and Master HDD. Using this information, an administrator can determine if a computer has passwords set in their environment.</p> <p>Using the following PowerShell script, running as administrator, the return code will range from 0 to 7.</p> <pre><code>(gwmi -Class LenovoBIOSPasswordSettings -Namespace root\\wmi).PasswordState\n</code></pre> <p>The result will map to one of the values in the table below:</p> 0 No password set 1 Power on password set 2 Supervisor password set 3 Power on password and Supervisor password set 4 User HDD or User HDD and Master password set 5 Power on password and (User HDD or User HDD and Master password) set 6 Supervisor password and (User HDD or User HDD and Master password) set 7 Power on password, Supervisor password, and (User HDD or User HDD and Master password) set <p>Note</p> <p>The information provided by the script will only return the state of the passwords, it will not return the actual passwords.</p>"},{"location":"ref/bios/bios_guide/#os-optimized-defaults","title":"OS Optimized Defaults","text":"<p>To make our BIOS compliant with the Microsoft Windows 8 and/or Windows 10 Certification Requirements, Lenovo has implemented a single setting, that when enabled and the default settings loaded, will set a group of settings to ensure the computer meets the requirements set forth by Microsoft and allow Windows 8 and newer operating systems to be installed on the hardware.

It has to be manually disabled if there is a need.

Lenovo provides VBScripts as well as an HTA Tool called Think BIOS Config tool to facilitate easier manipulation of BIOS settings from both a scripted context as well as a graphical context. These capabilities are implemented on most Think branded devices.</p> <p>To find more information on a particular BIOS setting for a system such as name, explanation or default value, navigate to https://pcsupport.lenovo.com . Type in the Model or MTM of the system and select the correct one from the drop down list. Click on Documentation and then look for the User Guide in the list of documents. In the User Guide, there will be a full listing of settings, descriptions, available values, and default values to reference.</p> <p>The Think BIOS Config tool is an HTA that can be run with an interface or directly from a command line to perform BIOS configurations. When double clicking the .hta file, it will run and provide a dynamic interface that shows all settings in the BIOS that are configurable by script for that computer.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>Think BIOS Config tool will ask for UAC elevation, since accessing the BIOS through WMI requires elevated privileges.</p> <p>Each setting will show the current value associated with the setting. In drop down lists it will provide all possible values for that setting. When a value is changed for a setting, the setting name will turn red as a visual indicator that the setting is now different. To commit changes to be applied on the next reboot, use the Save Changed Settings button.</p> <p>The interface also has the ability to create an .INI file with a full list of settings to use for other systems of the same model. The interface has the ability to import a previously created .INI file to configure a full set of settings or a subset of settings to be applied to a computer.</p> <p>The Think BIOS Config tool has the ability to be run from a command line for System Administrators to change settings through a SCCM software push or SCCM or MDT task sequence for deploying an operating system.</p> <p>Full documentation for the execution of the Think BIOS Config tool can be found in the User Guide which is included in the .zip file available in this blog post .</p> <p>In addition to the Think BIOS Config tool, Lenovo has VBScripts to assist with changing and viewing BIOS Settings.

The ListAll.vbs script is best used in an Administrator command prompt with cscript.</p> <pre><code>    Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.15063]\n    (c) 2017 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\n\n    C:\\WINDOWS\\system32&gt;cscript.exe ListAll.vbs\n</code></pre> <p>The LoadDefaults.vbs script will load the factory defaults for the computer. To find the defaults, reference the User Guide documentation for the specific model.</p> <p>The SetConfig.vbs and SetConfigPassword.vbs are used to set individual settings. The only difference between the two scripts is that SetConfigPassword.vbs requires an extra parameter for the input of the Supervisor password to change the setting, when a Supervisor password is set on the BIOS.</p> <p>The final script is the SetSupervisorPassword.vbs script. This script facilitates the change of the Supervisor password when one is currently set on the BIOS. This script does not allow for the initial setting of the BIOS Supervisor Password.</p> <p>The provided VBScripts can also be incorporated into a software deployment through SCCM or through a SCCM or MDT task sequence for OSD.</p> <p>For PowerShell examples, see Appendix B.

This includes Boot progress, BIOS setup screen, command line OS or command line diagnostic program screens.\n\nA client system can redirect its console text to the AMPS provided console using either Telnet or SSH.\n\nFollow these steps to use Text Redirection using AMPS:\n\n1. In Configuration Manager navigate to **Assets and Compliance** \\&amp;gt; **Overview** \\&amp;gt; **Devices** \\&amp;gt; **All Systems** node.\n2. Expand the **Devices** node and click **All Systems**.\n3. In the right pane, right-click the device on which you want to perform Text Redirection.\n4. In the shortcut menu that appears, select **DASH** , then **Text Redirection**.\nAlternatively, on the Configuration Manager ribbon, select the **DASH** tab, then **Text Redirection**.\n\n![DASH tab with DASH Ribbon](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/img/dash/29-dash.png)\n\n The **Text Redirection** Screen appears and shows:\n\n   1. Drop down list with available protocols for text redirection, SSH and Telnet respectively. (SSH is the default.)\n   2. The Name of the Service that runs on the system to redirect the text.\n   3. The port through which the text will be redirected.\n   4. The information/status is stated \u2013 e.g., Support for OTP (one time password)\n\n  ![Text Redirection](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/img/dash/42-dash.png)\n\n#### USB-Redirection\n\nUSB Redirection provides a Virtual USB device which reads data from a remote image file, allowing the BIOS to boot from a remote image file such as _.iso_. See also [USB Redirection](#usb-redirection) above.\n\nThe ISO image file must be available as a _http_ web URL.\n\nTo initiate a USB redirection for a system, perform the following steps:\n\n 1. In Configuration Manager navigate to **Assets and Compliance\\Overview \\Devices\\All Systems** node. Expand the **Devices** node and click **All Systems**.\n 2. In the right pane, right-click the device on which you want to perform USB redirection.\n 3. In the shortcut menu that opens, point to **DASH** and then click **USB Redirection**.\n\nThe **USB Redirection** screen appears and displays the following:\n\n    - The name of the system for whose USB, AMPS is going to attach the remote URL\n    - The URL that has to be attached to the systems USB.\n     If the USB is already attached to the remote URL,then the attached URL is displayed , and the option to edit the URL field is grayed out. You can disconnect the attached USB by clicking the **Disconnect** button on the screen.\n    - If the USB is not attached, you can replace/update any existing URL or enter a new valid URL and click the **Connect** button\n\n![USB Redirection](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/img/dash/43-dash.png)\n\n 4.

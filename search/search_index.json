Refer to this introduction article with links to the SU Helper reference guide:  https://blog.lenovocdrt.com/introducing-su-helper-utility/</p> <p>You may also continue to use the group policy controls to control the update process by defining the timing and filtering as needed.</p> <p>Refer to the CommercialVantage.admx under the System Update category for more details.</p> <p>When Commercial Vantage is installed, will it automatically create a scheduled task to install System Updates?</p> <p>A scheduled task is created by a background process a few minutes after installation.  The scheduled task is configured to run weekly, at a random day/time.  The randomness helps manage the load on Lenovo's server (e.g. so that not every Lenovo PC in the world is checking for updates at the same time).  If the PC happens to be turned off (or sleeping) at the time the scheduled task is triggered, then Windows itself should try to execute the scheduled task as soon as possible after it is missed.  The scheduled task can be found in Task Scheduler -&gt; Task Scheduler Library -&gt; Lenovo -&gt; ImController -&gt; Plugins -&gt; LenovoSystemUpdatePlugin_WeeklyTask.  There is an additional task (LenovoSystemUpdatePlugin_TVSUUpdateTask_Once) which is designed to run 1 time shortly after installation to install any pending critical updates.</p> <p>Can the administrator use a Group Policy to configure a schedule?</p> <p>Yes, there are policies for this in Group Policy Editor -&gt; Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Commercial Vantage -&gt; Device -&gt; System Update.

Trigger Auto Update for filtered updates In this scenario, the admin may want to trigger an update session that only installs certain package types, reboot types or even specific updates specified by their package IDs. An example where this would be useful is if you leverage Windows Update for Business for driver and firmware updates; however, there is a particular update that is not offered through Windows Update which you need to have deployed immediately. Commercial Vantage can be deployed on devices with Auto Update disabled and SUHelper can be used on-demand to install specific updates just be sending the command to the clients. Exclude an update from being installed In some cases, a customer may find that a particular update has a compatibility issue with their environment when they apply the update to a set of test devices. To prevent that update from being applied to all production devices, SUHelper can be used to add the specific package ID(s) to an \"exclude\" list on the production devices.

This allows the content to be pulled from a server that is geographically close.

This requires the latest version of Commercial Vantage released July 2024 and the SU Helper utility deployed on the clients.  Refer to this introduction article with links to the SU Helper reference guide:  https://blog.lenovocdrt.com/introducing-su-helper-utility/</p> <p>You may also continue to use the group policy controls to control the update process by defining the timing and filtering as needed.</p> <p>Refer to the CommercialVantage.admx under the System Update category for more details.</p> <p>When Commercial Vantage is installed, will it automatically create a scheduled task to install System Updates?</p> <p>A scheduled task is created by a background process a few minutes after installation.  The scheduled task is configured to run weekly, at a random day/time.  The randomness helps manage the load on Lenovo's server (e.g. so that not every Lenovo PC in the world is checking for updates at the same time).  If the PC happens to be turned off (or sleeping) at the time the scheduled task is triggered, then Windows itself should try to execute the scheduled task as soon as possible after it is missed.  The scheduled task can be found in Task Scheduler -&gt; Task Scheduler Library -&gt; Lenovo -&gt; ImController -&gt; Plugins -&gt; LenovoSystemUpdatePlugin_WeeklyTask.  There is an additional task (LenovoSystemUpdatePlugin_TVSUUpdateTask_Once) which is designed to run 1 time shortly after installation to install any pending critical updates.</p> <p>Can the administrator use a Group Policy to configure a schedule?</p> <p>Yes, there are policies for this in Group Policy Editor -&gt; Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Commercial Vantage -&gt; Device -&gt; System Update.  The day and time can be configured, as well as enabling/disabling auto updates (and preventing the end-user from changing this in the GUI).  You can also configure system update to include or exclude certain categories of updates, such as firmware or BIOS.</p> <p>Details about configuring Group Policies, or using registry files instead, can be found in the Commercial Vantage Deployment Guide  Also here:  https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/hf003321</p> <p>Can an end-user set the date/time for this schedule, using the Commercial Vantage GUI?</p> <p>No.  The only thing the end-user can do is click on \"Check for Updates\".

That scheduled task would execute:</p> <pre><code>C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Lenovo\\System Update\\tvsu.exe /CM\n</code></pre> <p>The rest of the command line parameters would be specified as a Policy in the registry using either Group Policy or by manipulating the registry directly at:</p> <pre><code>HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Lenovo\\System Update\\UserSettings\\General\nValue: [REG_SZ] AdminCommandLine\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>When using a custom scheduled task, a new task should be created, and the default task created when System Update is installed should be disabled.</p> <p>Additionally, the \"SchedulerAbility\" setting must be set to \u201cNO\u201d in the registry at:</p> <p><pre><code>\"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Lenovo\\System Update\\Preferences\\UserSettings\\Scheduler\"\n</code></pre> This will prevent System Update from re-enabling the default tasks.</p> <p>Does System Update create temporary admin accounts?</p> <p>Yes.

Furthermore, there is a \"View details\" link, which displays the contents of the readme file for the update package which offers additional details such as supported models, supported operating systems, supported devices, what the package does, changes in the release, determining which version is installed, installation and uninstallation instructions and more.</p> <p>When using System Update to search for update packages, System Update will display search results in four severity categories, as explained above: Critical, Recommended, and Optional. For a description and example of each category severity level, see the following:</p> <p>Critical update packages  are considered mandatory for the system to function properly. Failure to install these packages could result in data loss, system malfunction, or hardware failure. The administrator can choose to have critical updates downloaded and installed automatically on a scheduled basis. A critical package can be, for example:</p> <ul> <li>A hard disk drive firmware update that if not applied could result in hard disk drive failure.</li> <li>A BIOS upgrade that if not applied will result in system lags.</li> <li>A software patch to an application that if not applied could result in data loss a system.</li> </ul> <p>Recommended update packages  are packages recommended by Lenovo to ensure the system working at optimal performance. This severity level should be the default for most drivers. A recommended package can be, for example:</p> <ul> <li>A video driver that corrects an issue that may cause blue screen issues.</li> <li>A BIOS update that contains minor fixes that may impact a small group of customers.</li> <li>A power management driver that will allow a mobile system to get the most out of its battery life.</li> </ul> <p>Optional update packages  will improve the computing experience but are not necessary. An optional package can be, for example:</p> <ul> <li>An application or utility that is not needed for the system to operate but provides benefit if it is installed.</li> <li>Any BIOS or driver upgrade that has been updated only to support newer systems and contains no fixes.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>Some of updates may depend on certain Window components. Ensure that your Windows operating system is up to date by running Windows Update.</p> <p>Once all the updates desired have been selected, press Next. A review of the updates selected will be displayed. This will also provide a second chance to select updates to defer installation or deselect a package before they are downloaded and installed on the machine. Once the \"Download\" button is clicked, if any of the packages require a reboot after installation, a message box will appear letting the user know which package(s) requires it. Wait for the machine to reboot and finish the installation before doing anything else. Do not manually shut off the machine or put it into sleep mode during this time.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 3-6.

To enable logging set the following registry value:</p> <pre><code>KEY:  Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Lenovo\\System Update\\Preferences\\UCSettings\\Log\n\nVALUE: FileName\n\nDATA:  tvsu.log\n</code></pre> <p>The log files will be created here:</p> <p><code>C:\\ProgramData\\Lenovo\\SystemUpdate\\logs</code></p> <p>Typically the first step in isolating issues when running System Update is to make sure System Update can access the repository, whether that is over the Internet to access content directly from Lenovo or over an intranet network to access a local repository. Use standard network troubleshooting steps to verify the logged-on user account has access as required.</p> <p>When pulling content from Lenovo, System Update uses HTTPS to access content at https://download.lenovo.com/catalog  and https://download.lenovo.com/pccbbs . It will also access https://chifsr.lenovomm.com to record metrics of failed updates if metrics are enabled. These sites may need to be white listed to have access through a corporate firewall. These sites are hosted on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) which consists of hundreds of \"edge\" servers around the world.  A device will connect to the closest edge server to download content. The specific IP addresses of the available edge servers is always changing as the CDN is being maintained. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a specific IP address or addresses for white listing.</p> <p>There are no special ports required to be opened for System Update. In some cases the System Update application itself will need to be white listed to have access to the Internet. To ensure complete access for System Update to function properly, enable the following programs:</p> <pre><code>    %PROGRAMFILES%\\Lenovo\\System Update\\TvsuCommandLauncher.exe\n\n    %PROGRAMFILES%\\Lenovo\\System Update\\Tvsukernel.exe\n</code></pre> <p>The next step would be to review the log files generated by System Update. These files can be found in C:\\ProgramData\\Lenovo\\SystemUpdate\\logs. System Update will create a new log file each time it performs a search and install session. The log file name will include a timestamp to ensure the files are unique, such as: tvsu_200103171352.log</p> <p>The log file may be quite long. If there is a particular update that is having an issue, it may help to search the log file for the title of the update. In some cases an update may not be installing because System Update has determined it is not applicable based on the package descriptor meta data for the package. It may be easier to see the results of this applicability check when running System Update by command line if the -exporttowmi parameter is used. Various tools such as WMI Explorer can be used to then view the information located at:</p> <pre><code>root\\Lenovo\\Lenovo_Updates\n</code></pre> <p>Here you will find information similar to:</p> PackageID AdditionalInfo Severity Status Title Version n2irx01w Critical NotApplicable Intel PRO/1000 LAN Adapter Software (Windows 10 Version 1709 and 1803) - 10 [64] 12.18.9.11 <p>The following is a list of strings that can be searched for in the log file to find certain details from the System Update session that generated the log:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tvsukernel.CommandLineParameters.ValidateArguments : This will locate the section of the log where the command line used to execute System Update is parsed.

Passwords are not set from the factory unless requested by a customer and implemented for a specific custom model being ordered. Passwords can be utilized to protect the BIOS interface, power on of the computer, and hard disk.</p> <p>The BIOS interface is protected by the Supervisor Password (SVP). The Supervisor password must be provided when any settings are changed via scripting. The Supervisor password must be entered when accessing the BIOS by physical means in order to provide access to various security settings.</p> <p>The powering on of the device is protected by the Power-On Password (POP).

This includes firmware drivers, EFI applications, and especially the operating system.</li> <li>Trust Database: This check is performed against certificates stored in secure databases (called db and dbx) located directly in the UEFI firmware. Only if a signature is recognized as valid and trustworthy will the corresponding software be allowed to run.</li> <li>Key Management: This entire process is managed by cryptographic keys, such as the Platform Key (PK) and the Key Exchange Key (KEK), which ensure the integrity of the databases themselves.</li> </ul> <p>This mechanism establishes a secure chain of trust from the moment the device is powered on until the operating system is fully loaded.</p> <p>Multiple keys and databases are used for management:</p> <p> PK (Platform Key) - The central platform signature.

Devices from 2023 and older do not yet have this feature and are automatically operated in User Mode after installing the PK.</li> <li>Autopilot behavior: Autopilot does not write UEFI variables (PK/KEK/db/dbx); therefore, it does not change the mode. The expectation that Pro-Provisioning will change the mode from Deployed Mode to User Mode is therefore not fulfilled.

This includes Boot progress, BIOS setup screen, command line OS or command line diagnostic program screens.\n\nA client system can redirect its console text to the AMPS provided console using either Telnet or SSH.\n\nFollow these steps to use Text Redirection using AMPS:\n\n1. In Configuration Manager navigate to **Assets and Compliance** \\&amp;gt; **Overview** \\&amp;gt; **Devices** \\&amp;gt; **All Systems** node.\n2. Expand the **Devices** node and click **All Systems**.\n3. In the right pane, right-click the device on which you want to perform Text Redirection.\n4. In the shortcut menu that appears, select **DASH** , then **Text Redirection**.\nAlternatively, on the Configuration Manager ribbon, select the **DASH** tab, then **Text Redirection**.\n\n![DASH tab with DASH Ribbon](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/img/dash/29-dash.png)\n\n The **Text Redirection** Screen appears and shows:\n\n   1. Drop down list with available protocols for text redirection, SSH and Telnet respectively. (SSH is the default.)\n   2. The Name of the Service that runs on the system to redirect the text.\n   3. The port through which the text will be redirected.\n   4. The information/status is stated \u2013 e.g., Support for OTP (one time password)\n\n  ![Text Redirection](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/img/dash/42-dash.png)\n\n#### USB-Redirection\n\nUSB Redirection provides a Virtual USB device which reads data from a remote image file, allowing the BIOS to boot from a remote image file such as _.iso_. See also [USB Redirection](#usb-redirection) above.\n\nThe ISO image file must be available as a _http_ web URL.\n\nTo initiate a USB redirection for a system, perform the following steps:\n\n 1. In Configuration Manager navigate to **Assets and Compliance\\Overview \\Devices\\All Systems** node. Expand the **Devices** node and click **All Systems**.\n 2. In the right pane, right-click the device on which you want to perform USB redirection.\n 3. In the shortcut menu that opens, point to **DASH** and then click **USB Redirection**.\n\nThe **USB Redirection** screen appears and displays the following:\n\n    - The name of the system for whose USB, AMPS is going to attach the remote URL\n    - The URL that has to be attached to the systems USB.\n     If the USB is already attached to the remote URL,then the attached URL is displayed , and the option to edit the URL field is grayed out. You can disconnect the attached USB by clicking the **Disconnect** button on the screen.\n    - If the USB is not attached, you can replace/update any existing URL or enter a new valid URL and click the **Connect** button\n\n![USB Redirection](https://cdrt.github.io/mk_docs/img/dash/43-dash.png)\n\n 4.
